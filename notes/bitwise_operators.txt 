BITWISE OPERATRORS 

this operators work on individual bits.

1. & : The Bitwise and Operator allows one to have a left hand variable and a right hand 
variable that are anded together  i.e
    0 & 0 = 0
    0 & 1 = 0
    1 & 0 = 0
    1 & 1 = 1
    
    N/B this seem like binary operators to me 
    
2. | : The Bitwise Or operator allows one to have a left hand variable and a right hand 
variable that are or~ed together ie returns a 1 if a one exists in the equation 
    0 | 0 =  0
    0 | 1 =  1 
    1 | 0 =  1
    1 | 1 =  1

3. ^ : The Bitwise exculisive Or Operator known more as XOR this returns only a one if the inputs are
exclusive i.e different 
    0 ^ 0 = 0
    0 ^ 1 = 1
    1 ^ 0 = 1 
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    
4. ~ : The Bitwise Unary Operator is applied only one operand this negates a bit 
    ~ 0 = 1
    ~ 1 = 0

5. << >> : The Bitwise Left Shift and Right Operators these 
    1 << 7 = This bit is moved 7 places to the left assuming this is padded with 0s
    10000000
