I think this is a linux familiarization process
The asterisk after  hello  means its an executable 


Make Clang 
make is a utility for compiling source code 
make is helpful for huge projects

"make hello"
will compile a hello.c source code file 

when you run "make"

it invokes the c compiler called clang in this case 

it runs clang with a number of options 
 you can run clang without options like 


"clang hello.c"

we can provide -o to produce output to a certain file e.g 

"clang hello.c -o hello"

would produce output to hello file 

we can provide -Wall option to help us check for all the warnings 

"clang hello.c -Wall -o hello"

We can  provide another option to stop compilation incase errors or warnings appear -Werror

"clang hello.c -Wall -Werror -o hello"

We can provide anothert option -ggdb this enables debugging information 

"clang hello.c -Wall -Werror -ggdb -o hello"
